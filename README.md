# Project MESIM — Quadratic Equation Trainer

**ENSIIE · Simulation Methods · 2026**

This project consists on using the simulation method to randomly generate the coefficient of the quadratic equation to match each case. The random coefficient is generated by using the **Inversion Method** by taking the set and each assigned value of probability correspond to each number.

This project has been built inside the python, and the javascript app.

In python, we need to run **pip install -r requirements.txt** to setup the package dependencies and then we can just run the **python main.py** to startup the application. On the other hand, we have deployed it as app online [Project MESIM](https://mesim.sokhengdin.dev)

## Structure

```

├── generators.py      # Sampling logic (inversion method, exercise generators)
├── gui.py             # Desktop GUI (CustomTkinter)
├── main.py            # Entry point
└── requirements.txt   # Python dependencies

## Setup & Run

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
python main.py
```

> **macOS** — `cairosvg` requires Cairo: `brew install cairo`

## Exercise Types

| Type | Condition | Probability |
|------|-----------|-------------|
| 1    | Δ < 0 — no real solution | 1/5 |
| 2    | Δ = 0 — one repeated root | 2/5 |
| 3    | Δ > 0 — two distinct roots | 2/5 |
